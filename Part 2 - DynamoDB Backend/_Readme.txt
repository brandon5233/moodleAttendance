The following is the second attendance system developed with DynamoDB as the backend.
It is a standalone system, and not designed to replace or interact with the system in part 1.

The backend.py file acts as an API endpoint to the frontend (not developed as part of this project)
The rest of the files are used to setup and load data into the database.
